*DESCRIPTION*

This Jupyter notebook is dedicated to Twitter sentiment analysis, a common application of natural language processing (NLP) in social media analytics. It starts by importing necessary libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for data handling and visualization, alongside NLP-focused tools like nltk, re, and sklearn.

The dataset, containing tweets with associated sentiments, is loaded and preprocessed to clean the raw text data. This involves converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation, links, special characters, and stop words, as well as tokenizing and lemmatizing the tweets. These preprocessing steps are crucial for ensuring that the text is standardized and suitable for modeling.

Following this, the notebook performs exploratory analysis by visualizing sentiment distribution and the most common words used across sentiment categories. Text data is then vectorized using techniques like TF-IDF or CountVectorizer to transform it into numerical form for machine learning algorithms.

The sentiment prediction model is built using classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Support Vector Machines. The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.

This notebook provides a complete pipeline for classifying tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, making it valuable for brands, researchers, or anyone monitoring public opinion on Twitter.
